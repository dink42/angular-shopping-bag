[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ymtj9i-eyvel3)

+ Just practicing, honestly im stuck with React and Django, cant decide wich one to dive in to.
+ This was a test with Angular but when looking at work, the demands are at React and Django.
+ This was template i followed on stackblitz and Angular, anyone can do it. Check stackblitz out, wish they had Django doe.
